# About

I have spent nearly a decade as a backend engineer and software architect, working closely with teams facing tough technical challenges. My strength lies in quickly understanding complex systems, spotting bottlenecks, and recommending practical improvements.

I've built architectures that handle millions of transactions, optimized cloud setups saving thousands per month, and streamlined developer workflows to reduce friction and frustration.

My goal isn't to rewrite your entire stack. Instead, I'll pinpoint specific, high-impact changes. These are usually things you'll wish you'd found sooner. My audits are quick, honest, and always free.
