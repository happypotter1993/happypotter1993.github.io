# Hi, I'm Aditya.

I help tech teams quickly find and fix things that slow them down. No complicated processes, no endless meetings.

I'm good at identifying bottlenecks, simplifying overly complex systems, and reducing friction for developers. I offer free audits because I'd rather demonstrate value first and discuss fees later. I prioritize measurable improvements that save money, improve efficiency, or both.

If you're feeling stuck or want a fresh set of eyes on your architecture, infrastructure, or workflows, let's talk.
