# Projects I've fixed

## Reducing cloud infrastructure costs by 80%
An industry-specific SaaS platform struggled with high AWS costs. My audit quickly identified inefficient instance utilization and overly complex services. Simple optimizations dramatically lowered their monthly bill.

## Database and API bottleneck fixes
A growing product startup faced frequent database slowdowns. After identifying inefficient queries and redundant database calls, response times improved tenfold, leading to happier users and fewer outages.

## Simplified workflows, less frustration
An automotive client was losing hours weekly due to complex deployment processes. After setting up GitHub Actions and improving their CI/CD pipeline, deployments became straightforward, and productivity improved significantly.
