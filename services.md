# How I can help

I offer straightforward consulting as a fractional CTO or technical advisor. Typically, I:

1. Conduct a quick, free audit of your tech stack (architecture, databases, APIs, workflows).
2. Clearly outline specific bottlenecks or pain points worth fixing.
3. Provide simple, actionable recommendations.
4. Implement agreed changes quickly, clearly, and measurably.

**Common improvements include:**

- Database performance tuning  
- API optimization  
- Reducing cloud infrastructure costs  
- Streamlining CI/CD workflows  
- Establishing best practices around monitoring, logging, and security  
- Simplifying developer tooling and reducing friction  

I charge only for implementations we agree upon after the audit. No hidden costs or pressure.
